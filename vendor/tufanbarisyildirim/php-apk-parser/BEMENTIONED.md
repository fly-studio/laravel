# How To Be Mentioned
As php-apk-parser developers, we support and love all open source lovers. You are always welcome to use and develop any of our projects. If you are an open source user / lover / supporter please mention this on your project to help spread the word.
You need at least a public "Open source credits" page to be mentioned on apk-parser page as a apk-parser user. If you have such a page, please open a pull request with an edit to README.md, and in the body of the pull request include a link to your open source credits page.

Since it's an individual project, for sure you can be mentioned just with a donation too :)
